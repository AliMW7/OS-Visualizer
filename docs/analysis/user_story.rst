Graphical Process Scheduling and Memory Allocation Visualizer  
=============================================================  

**As a**  
Computer Engineering Student  

**I want**  
A software tool that graphically demonstrates process scheduling policies (such as FCFS)  
and memory allocation policies (such as First Fit).  

**So that**  
I can have a better understanding of these concepts.  

Acceptance Criteria  
-------------------  

**Process Scheduling Policies**  
├── FCFS (First Come, First Served)  
├── SPN (Shortest Process Next)  
├── SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)  
├── RR (Round Robin)  
├── HRRN (Highest Response Ratio Next)  
├── MLQ (Multi-Level Queue)  

**Memory Allocation Policies**  
├── First Fit  
├── Next Fit  
├── Worst Fit  
├── Best Fit
