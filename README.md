# OS Visualizer

OS Visualizer is a tool designed to provide a visual representation of various operating system concepts and algorithms. It is a helpful resource for students and developers to better understand how OS algorithms work through interactive visualizations.

## Features

- **Memory Management**: visualizing Memory Management algorithms like FirstFit BestFit and NextFit.
- **CPU Scheduling Algorithms**: Simulate and visualize common CPU scheduling algorithms such as First-Come-First-Served (FCFS), Round-Robin (RR), Shortest Job First (SJF), and others.


## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Setup

   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd OS-Visualizer
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser to view the visualizations.

## Usage

- Open the relevant file from the interface to start the visualization of a particular OS concept.
- Follow the interactive controls to simulate the chosen algorithm and visualize the process flow.
