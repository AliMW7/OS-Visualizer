# OS Visualizer

OS Visualizer is a tool designed to provide a visual representation of various operating system concepts and algorithms. It is a helpful resource for students and developers to better understand how OS algorithms work through interactive visualizations.

## Features

- **Memory Management Algorithms**:
   - First Fit
   - Next Fit
   - Best Fit
   - Worst Fit
   
- **CPU Scheduling Algorithms**:
   - FCFS (First Come, First Served)
   - SPN (Shortest Process Next)
   - SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)
   - RR (Round Robin)
      - Set quantum for Round Robin (RR)
   - HRRN (Highest Response Ratio Next)

- Manually entering process data.
- Create random process
- Configure context switch for CPU Scheduling Algorithms
- Assigning different color for each process
- User guide


## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vitest
